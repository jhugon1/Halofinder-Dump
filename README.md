# Halofinder-Dump  

## Overview  
This repository contains a curated selection of code from my research in computational astrophysics, specifically focused on halo finding and analysis in cosmological simulations.  

While the full project remains private due to its ongoing nature and pending publication, this repository serves to highlight a subsection of my algorithm development, data analysis, and coding contributions within a physics-driven computational framework.  

Some scripts in this repository may reference external files that are not included. I have omitted them from this repository to maintain the integrity of the shared contributions that went into them.

### Project Context   
- The research focuses on identifying and analyzing dark matter halos in large-scale cosmological simulations.  
- The codebase involves numerical methods, statistical modeling, and computational techniques applied to astrophysical data.  
- This work contributes to an upcoming scientific publication, and as such, only a subset of non-sensitive code is shared here.

## Example plotting: Catalog Comparison Visualization
This plot visualizes differences in particles assigned to our computationally cheap, dynamical halofinder (middle plots), and a comparison catalog of halos generated from multi-snapshot data (right plots). Plot generated from halo_visualization_comparison script
