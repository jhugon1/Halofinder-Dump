## Example plotting: Catalog Comparison Visualization
This plot visualizes differences in particles assigned to our computationally cheap, dynamical halofinder (middle plots), and a comparison catalog of halos generated from multi-snapshot data (right plots). Plot generated from halo_visualization_comparison script
