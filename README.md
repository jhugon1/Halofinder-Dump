# Halofinder-Dump  

## Overview  
This repository contains a curated selection of code from my research in computational astrophysics, specifically focused on halo finding and analysis in cosmological simulations.  

While the full project remains private due to its ongoing nature and pending publication, this repository serves to highlight a subsection of my algorithm development, data analysis, and coding contributions within a physics-driven computational framework.  

Some scripts in this repository may reference external files that are not included. I have omitted them from this repository to maintain the integrity of the shared contributions that went into them.

## Example plotting: Catalog Comparison Visualization
This plot visualizes differences in particles assigned to our computationally cheap, dynamical halofinder (middle plots), and a comparison catalog of halos generated from multi-snapshot data (right plots). Plot generated from halo_visualization_comparison script
